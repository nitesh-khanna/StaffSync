# StaffSync
StaffSync is a full-stack web application developed to efficiently manage employees and departments within an organization. The application features a clean and intuitive interface with a navigation bar that includes sections for both employees and departments. In the department section, users can add new departments by entering the department name and description through a dedicated form component. Upon submission, the application dynamically updates the department table to reflect the new entry, with each row in the table offering options to update or delete the corresponding department. In the employee section, users can add new employees by providing their first name, last name, email, and selecting a department from a drop-down list that is dynamically populated based on the existing departments. This design ensures that employees are always mapped to valid departments, and encourages the creation of departments before employee assignment. Similar to departments, the employee table allows for updating and deleting individual records. The project demonstrates strong use of CRUD operations, component-based architecture, and data linkage across modules, while ensuring consistency and integrity in the application's data flow.
